Leaf - A lightweight Dependency Injection Framework
===================================================

Yet another dependency injection framwork?! Yeees!  
There are already a lot of frameworks for dependency injection. But they are really huge (e.g. [Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice)) or they are not supported anymore (e.g. [Feather](https://github.com/zsoltherpai/feather)).

I'm often looking for frameworks which can easily be used for Java SE applications (e.g. command line tools) or small Android Apps.
And that's what *Leaf* is for!

The goal of *Leaf* is to provide a simple and lightweight framework with the following advantages:

- easy creation of own dependency scopes
- only a few classes with a small footprint
- flexibility for own extensions (every method can be overridden)
- written with Test-Driven Development
- [JSR-330](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330) compatibility
- no further Maven dependencies


Contributions
=============

I like to improve this framework over time and you are very welcome to contribute to it.
Just create a pull-request or write an issue.
